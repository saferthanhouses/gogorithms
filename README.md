#### Playing with Search Algorithms in Golang

- [ ] Graphs should be created with Nodes and Edges from a text file (or randomly?)
- [ ] Graphs should have a starting point and a goal point and optional walls.
- [ ] Edges exist between vertical and horizontal neighbours.k 
- [ ] All spaces that are not interrupted by a wall have edges between them. 
- [ ] Implement algorithms that take a node and a goal and return an route from the starting point
to the goal.
